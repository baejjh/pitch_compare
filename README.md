Pitch Compare
===========

Based on the iOS app [InTune](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/intune-improve-test-your-intonation/id580791793?mt=8) created by Daniel Kazez, Peiqian Li, and Crispin Prebys. Pitch Compare was originally created because I wanted to see what it would sound like if the two notes were played harmonically. It sounded terrible.
